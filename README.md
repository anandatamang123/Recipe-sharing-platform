# Recipe Sharing Platform

## Introduction
The Recipe Sharing Platform is a web application designed for users to share and discover new recipes. It allows users to add, view, and delete recipes, complete with descriptions, ratings, and images. The goal of this project is to create a community-driven platform where food enthusiasts can exchange culinary ideas and inspirations.

## Features
- **Add Recipes**: Users can add new recipes with a title, description, rating, and optional image.
- **View Recipes**: Recipes are displayed in a grid layout, showcasing the title, description, rating, and image.
- **Delete Recipes**: Users can delete recipes they have added.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and DOM manipulation.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- Code editor (e.g., VSCode)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-sharing-platform.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd recipe-sharing-platform
    ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```
    or, if you prefer to use a local server:
    ```sh
    npx serve
    ```

## File Structure

### index.html
Contains the structure of the web application including the form for adding recipes and the container for displaying recipes.

### styles.css

- **Comments and Ratings**: Enable users to leave comments and additional ratings on recipes.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for personalized experiences.
- **Search and Filter**: Add functionality to search and filter recipes based on specific criteria.
- **Backend Integration**: Integrate with a backend service to store recipes in a database for persistence and scalability.

## Reflection
This project was a valuable experience in web development, covering essential concepts such as CRUD operations, form handling, and responsive design. While there were challenges, particularly with file handling and creating a responsive layout, these were overcome through research and iterative improvements. Future enhancements can make the platform more robust and user-friendly, fostering a stronger community around recipe sharing.
